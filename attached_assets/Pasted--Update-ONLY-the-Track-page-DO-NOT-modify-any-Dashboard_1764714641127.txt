**“Update ONLY the Track page.
DO NOT modify any Dashboard, Essentials, Experiments, or Learn page code.
DO NOT change any backend logic, data models, save function behavior, or mobile layout.
Only add styling + stress/mood inputs to the Track page.

GOAL 1 — Make the Track page match the Dashboard styling

Apply the same visual design used on the Dashboard:

Use the same container wrapper:

<div className='max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-6'>


Wrap each section (Vitals, How You Feel, Food Log, Daily Checklist) inside the same type of soft card component used on the Dashboard:

light background

rounded corners

padding

subtle shadow or border if used on Dashboard

Use the same typography classes (headers, section titles, etc.)

Use the same colors already used on the Dashboard.

Use consistent spacing with Tailwind classes:

space-y-6 between section blocks

md:grid md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-6 ONLY for desktop layout

Keep ALL mobile behavior unchanged.
Do not alter any mobile-first styles.
Only apply md: classes for desktop formatting.

GOAL 2 — Add Stress Tracking + Mood Tracking to the Track page

Insert a new section BELOW “How You Feel” and ABOVE the Food Log:

Stress Level

Label: “Stress Level (1–10)”

Use either:

<input type="number" min="1" max="10" />


or

<input type="range" min="1" max="10" />


Add small anchor text underneath:
“Calm” on the left, “Overwhelmed” on the right.

Mood Rating

Label: “Mood Today”

Use either:

<input type="number" min="1" max="10" />


or
a dropdown: “Good”, “Okay”, “Bad”

Add a textarea: “Mood Notes (optional)”

GOAL 3 — Link the Stress + Mood fields to the Dashboard

When the user taps Save Today’s Data, include these fields in the same saved object:

stress → number

mood → number or string (match the dashboard format)

moodNotes → string

Make sure the saved data is identical to what the Dashboard already expects so the Stress Trend and Mood Tracker immediately populate with real data.

GOAL 4 — Do NOT break mobile mode

Only apply md: prefixes for desktop changes

Do not change flex direction, spacing, or stacking on screens <768px

Mobile must look exactly the same as before

GOAL 5 — DO NOT change anything else in the app

No routing changes

No backend changes

No rename of components

No Dashboard edits

No global styling overrides

No color changes outside the Track page

Only update the Track page’s UI and add the new fields.”**
