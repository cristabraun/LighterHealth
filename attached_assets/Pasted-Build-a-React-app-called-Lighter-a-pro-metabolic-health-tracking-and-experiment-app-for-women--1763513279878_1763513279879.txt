Build a React app called "Lighter" - a pro-metabolic health tracking and experiment app for women.

CORE PURPOSE:
Help women heal their metabolism by tracking vitals, running personalized experiments, and seeing what makes THEIR body feel lighter (emotionally, energetically, physically).

KEY FEATURES:

1. ONBOARDING:
- Welcome screen with messaging: "Become Lighter - Emotionally, Energetically, Physically"
- Brief intro: This is NOT a diet app. We track energy first, weight loss is a side effect.
- Ask for name
- Quick metabolic assessment (current symptoms)

2. DAILY TRACKING:
- Morning temperature (°F) - required
- Resting pulse (bpm) - required  
- Energy level (1-10 slider)
- Sleep quality (1-10 slider)
- Digestion (Good/Okay/Poor buttons)
- Optional notes field
- Shows trend charts over time

3. EXPERIMENT LIBRARY:
Create 7 detailed experiment cards:
- 7-Day Carrot Salad (for gut/estrogen)
- Daily Orange Juice Protocol (for glucose/energy)
- Add Carbs at Dinner (for sleep/thyroid)
- Reduce Cardio Intensity (for cortisol)
- Morning Salt + OJ (for adrenals)
- Sleep Optimization (for recovery)
- Magnesium Glycinate (for sleep/stress)

Each experiment card needs:
- Title
- Duration (7, 14, or 21 days)
- Category badge (Energy/Sleep/Digestion/Recovery)
- WHY section (science explanation)
- HOW section (exact instructions)
- WHEN section (timing)
- WHAT TO EXPECT (timeline of changes)
- "Start Experiment" button

4. ACTIVE EXPERIMENTS:
- Shows currently running experiments
- Progress bar (Day X of Y)
- Daily checklist for each experiment
- Notes section for observations
- "Complete" or "Stop Early" buttons

5. SMART RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on tracked data patterns, suggest experiments:
- IF avg temp < 97.5°F → Suggest OJ Protocol + Add Carbs
- IF avg pulse > 90 + low temp → Suggest Reduce Cardio + Stress protocols  
- IF poor sleep → Suggest Magnesium + Carbs at Dinner
- IF low energy → Suggest OJ Protocol + Reduce Cardio
- Show these as personalized cards on home dashboard

6. DASHBOARD/HOME:
- Greeting: "Hey [name]!"
- Quick stats (latest temp, pulse, energy)
- Personalized recommendations based on their data
- Active experiments section
- Quick action buttons (Track Today, Browse Experiments)

7. PROGRESS VIEW:
- Temperature trend chart (last 30 days)
- Pulse trend chart
- Energy levels chart
- Correlation view (show when experiments started vs. metric changes)
- Averages displayed

8. NAVIGATION:
Bottom tab bar with 4 tabs:
- Home (dashboard)
- Track (daily input form)
- Experiments (library + active)
- Progress (charts)

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Modern, clean, feminine aesthetic
- Warm color palette: coral/orange gradients (metabolic warmth)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use icons from lucide-react
- Charts using recharts library
- Celebrate wins (confetti when temp rises above 98°F, streaks, etc.)

DATA STORAGE:
- Use localStorage for now (no backend yet)
- Store: user profile, daily logs, active experiments, experiment history

UI TONE:
- Encouraging, warm, supportive
- Anti-diet language: "nourish" not "restrict", "energy" not "calories"
- Empowering: "Your body knows what it needs, we help you discover it"
- Phrases like: "You're glowing!", "Progress!", "Your temp is rising!"

Make it beautiful, functional, and encouraging. This app should make women feel LIGHTER and excited to track their progress.
