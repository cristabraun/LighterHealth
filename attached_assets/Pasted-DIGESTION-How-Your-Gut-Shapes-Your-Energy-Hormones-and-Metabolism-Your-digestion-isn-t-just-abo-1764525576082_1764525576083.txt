DIGESTION — How Your Gut Shapes Your Energy, Hormones, and Metabolism

Your digestion isn’t just about food breakdown — it’s directly tied to your energy, mood, hormones, inflammation, and weight regulation.

In the pro-metabolic view, a healthy gut means:

You absorb nutrients easily

Your meals give you steady energy

Your hormones stay balanced

Stress stays lower

Your metabolism runs faster

Bloating and constipation fade

Your body feels safe enough to release stored fat

When digestion is sluggish, irritated, or inflamed, your whole body shifts into stress mode.

Why Digestion Matters in the Pro-Metabolic Approach

Digestion affects:

1. Thyroid Function

Inflammation, endotoxin, and low stomach acid all suppress thyroid activity — which slows metabolism and energy production.

2. Hormones

A stressed gut increases estrogen recycling and decreases progesterone.

3. Blood Sugar Stability

Poor digestion → unstable glucose → adrenaline/cortisol spikes → tired/wired cycles.

4. Nervous System Calm

A smooth, easy gut = calm parasympathetic (“rest & digest”) tone.

5. Bloating & Water Retention

Almost always related to poor motility, stress hormones, or specific foods.
Not because you “ate too many calories.”

Signs Your Digestion Needs Support

Bloating after meals

Constipation or slow motility

Loose stools

Gas or cramping

Puffy face

Heartburn

Feeling heavy or inflamed

Anxiety after eating

Sugar cravings after meals

Afternoon crash

These are often stress + low stomach acid + endotoxin issues, not “bad digestion genes.”

What Improves Digestion (Pro-Metabolic Tools)
1. Regular Eating

Skipping meals slows stomach acid, slows motility, and increases stress hormones.

Eating every 3–4 hours keeps digestion smooth.

2. Warm, Cooked, Easy-to-Digest Foods

Your gut loves warmth and softness.

Best options include:

Cooked fruits

Orange juice

Mashed potatoes

Eggs

Gelatin

Stews

White rice

Ripe fruits

Cold, raw, fibrous foods often increase bloating.

3. Carrot Salad — The Famous Ray Peat Digestion Tool

Daily raw carrot salad helps:

Reduce endotoxin

Clean the intestine

Improve gut motility

Balance estrogen

Reduce bloating

Support liver function

Improve mood + energy

Basic recipe:
Shredded carrot + vinegar + salt + a bit of coconut oil (optional)

Taken ideally before lunch or early afternoon.

4. White Button Mushrooms

White mushrooms reduce:

Aromatase (estrogen conversion)

Inflammation

Endotoxin

Bloating

Mood swings related to estrogen dominance

Cook them well — they’re more powerful cooked.

5. Gelatin & Collagen

Gelatin balances amino acids from muscle meats and supports:

Gut lining

Digestion

Joint health

Thyroid support

Ideal as:

Gelatin gummies

In orange juice

In coffee

Mixed into warm drinks

6. Salt

Salt improves stomach acid, adrenal stability, and digestion.

Signs you need more:

Feeling puffy

Afternoon cravings

Dizziness

Irritability

Constipation

Add salt to meals freely.

7. Stress Reduction

A stressed gut is a slow gut.

Slow breathing

Eating sitting down

Warm foods

Avoiding multitasking while eating

Short walks after meals

These shift your body back into “digest mode.”

Helpful Daily Routine Example

Morning:
OJ + collagen → calm stomach, stable glucose

Lunch:
Protein + carbs + carrot salad

Mid-afternoon:
Fruit + cottage cheese or yogurt

Dinner:
Protein + cooked starch + mushrooms

Before bed:
Honey + milk or fruit to keep cortisol down
