Switch the entire app into FREE 30-DAY BETA MODE with NO payments required. Implement the following changes exactly:

1. LANDING PAGE CTA:

* Replace all instances of “Start 3-Day Trial” with:
  “Join the Free 30-Day Beta”
* The button must route directly to the SIGN UP page (not Stripe, not checkout).
* Ensure this applies to desktop and mobile layouts.

2. DISABLE STRIPE COMPLETELY:

* Disable all Stripe checkout redirects.
* Do NOT collect any payment information.
* Do NOT require cards during beta.
* Leave Stripe code intact but bypass it entirely while beta mode is active.

3. BETA USER TAGGING:

* On user signup, automatically assign:

  * isBetaUser = true
  * betaStartDate = current timestamp
  * betaExpiresAt = current timestamp + 30 days
* Store this on the user record in the database.

4. AUTOMATIC 30-DAY LOCKOUT:

* On EVERY login and on EVERY protected route:

  * If isBetaUser === true AND current date > betaExpiresAt:

    * Immediately block access
    * Redirect to /upgrade
* Create an /upgrade page that:

  * Explains the beta has ended
  * Displays “Continue with Lighter™ for $19/month”
  * Contains the Stripe checkout button (but DO NOT activate Stripe yet)

5. AUTH FLOW FIX:

* Ensure:

  * New users ALWAYS see “Create your free beta account”
  * Existing users ONLY see “Welcome back”
* Never send new users to a “Welcome back” screen.
* Login and Register must be fully separated logically.

6. ROUTING BEHAVIOR:

* Approved beta users will:

  * Click the public site button
  * Be taken to SIGN UP
  * After signup → routed into the app dashboard directly
* No payment walls during beta.

7. ADMIN SAFETY:

* Add a simple admin override so I can manually extend beta time for any user later if needed.

8. VISUAL CONSISTENCY:

* All auth pages (login, signup, beta expired) must match the dark Lighter™ theme.
* No white/light mode remnants anywhere.

9. DO NOT:

* Delete Stripe
* Break existing payment code
* Change pricing ($19/month remains visible on upgrade page only)

10. FINAL STEP:

* After implementation, clearly summarize:

  * What changed
  * What was disabled
  * How beta expiration is enforced
  * How Stripe will be reactivated later

Implement this cleanly, safely, and without breaking existing accounts.
