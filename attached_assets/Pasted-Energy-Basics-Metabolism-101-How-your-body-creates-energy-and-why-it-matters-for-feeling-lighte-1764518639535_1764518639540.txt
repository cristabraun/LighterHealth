Energy Basics — Metabolism 101

How your body creates energy — and why it matters for feeling lighter.

Your metabolism is not about burning calories.
It’s about producing energy so your cells can function with ease — warmth, calmness, stable mood, steady energy, good digestion, glowing skin, and a body that feels safe.

In the pro-metabolic world (inspired by Ray Peat), “good metabolism” means:

Your cells are producing energy efficiently

Your thyroid is active

Your body feels warm, not cold

You’re using sugar for fuel instead of stress hormones

Your digestion is calm

Your sleep is restorative

You feel emotionally grounded

When your metabolism is working, everything in your life feels easier.

When it’s not, you feel the opposite — tired, anxious, cold, bloated, wired-but-exhausted, craving sugar, gaining weight even when “eating clean,” and forcing yourself through life.

Here’s what’s happening at the cellular level.

☀️ Your cells run on sugar + oxygen

The bioenergetic, Peat-inspired view is simple:

Your cells need glucose + oxygen to make energy (ATP) efficiently.
When they have both, they produce:

lots of ATP

carbon dioxide (which is good!)

warmth

steady energy

calm nervous system function

a high metabolic rate

This is called oxidative metabolism, and it’s the foundation of healing your body.

🌙 When your body can’t make energy well… it uses stress instead.

If you’re under-eating, skipping carbs, fasting, overtraining, or overwhelmed, your body switches from energy production to survival mode.

Instead of glucose + oxygen, your body uses:

Adrenaline

Cortisol

Stored fat (which is mostly PUFA — inflammatory)

This leads to:

cold hands and feet

anxiety

irritability

poor sleep

hormonal imbalances

bloating

water retention

slow digestion

stubborn weight gain

You feel like your body is “working against you,” but it’s simply running on stress.

🍊 Why carbs are essential (not optional)

In the pro-metabolic approach, carbohydrates are the preferred fuel of the body.

Ray Peat’s teachings emphasize:

fruit

honey

orange juice

milk

root vegetables

easily digestible sugars

These support the thyroid, lower stress hormones, and help your liver store glycogen — which keeps blood sugar stable.

When your liver is fueled, you experience:

✔ stable energy
✔ calmer mood
✔ fewer cravings
✔ warmer body temperature
✔ easier weight loss

Carbs = metabolic support.

🔥 What a healthy metabolism feels like

When your metabolism is “on,” you experience:

Warm hands and feet

Restful sleep

More stable cycles

Fewer cravings

Easier digestion

Steady mood

More joy

Less anxiety

Weight that naturally trends toward healthy

Energy that lasts all day without caffeine crashes

You feel like yourself again.

✨ How Lighter™ helps you restore metabolic energy

This app teaches you how to:

fuel your body so it feels safe

support your thyroid through food

balance carbs + protein

avoid metabolic stressors

use gentle experiments to learn what works for you

track the signs of healing (temp, pulse, energy)

shift your body away from stress metabolism and toward real energy production

You don’t heal your metabolism by force, discipline, or deprivation.
You heal it by giving your body what it’s been missing.

Warmth. Nourishment. Safety. Carbs. Protein. Rest. Understanding.
