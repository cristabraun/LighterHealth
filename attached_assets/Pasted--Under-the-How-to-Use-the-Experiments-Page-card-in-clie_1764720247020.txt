**"Under the 'How to Use the Experiments Page' card in client/src/pages/experiments.tsx, add a collapsible accordion section titled 'Start Here'. Use the existing Accordion components (Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, AccordionContent).

Use a lavender theme similar to the Healing Tools color (#E9D8FD for background and #6B46C1 for text).

DO NOT modify any existing content or layout.

Add this exact JSX directly below the 'How to Use the Experiments Page' card:

<div className="mt-4">
  <Accordion type="single" collapsible>
    <AccordionItem value="start-here">
      <AccordionTrigger className="text-base font-medium bg-violet-100 text-violet-700 px-4 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-violet-200 transition">
        Start Here
      </AccordionTrigger>

      <AccordionContent className="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-4 bg-white p-4 border border-gray-200 rounded-xl shadow-sm mt-2">
        <p>
          Before exploring all of the experiments, begin with these three foundations.
          They give you the clearest picture of how your metabolism and nervous system
          are responding day-by-day. Treat them like gentle discovery tools—not strict rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1. Daily Raw Carrot Salad</strong><br />
          Supports digestion, lowers endotoxin, and helps calm the system.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. Temperature Before & After Meals</strong><br />
          In addition to the morning temperature and pulse you track on the Track page,
          try checking them before and after eating.<br />
          — If warmth and pulse rise: your body is converting food into energy well.<br />
          — If they drop: the meal likely slowed digestion or added stress.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Remove PUFA Oils</strong><br />
          Reducing polyunsaturated fats helps support cellular energy, hormonal balance,
          and digestion. Many people feel warmer and more stable as they lower PUFAs.
        </p>

        <p>These three experiments create a strong baseline. Your body will give you insight starting from here.</p>
