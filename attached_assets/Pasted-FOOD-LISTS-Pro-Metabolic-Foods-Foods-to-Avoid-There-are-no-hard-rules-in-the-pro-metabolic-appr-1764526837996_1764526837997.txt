FOOD LISTS — Pro-Metabolic Foods & Foods to Avoid

There are no hard rules in the pro-metabolic approach.
Your body, history, stress levels, digestion, and metabolism are unique.

Just because a certain food isn’t working for you right now doesn’t mean it will be off-limits forever. As your metabolism heals, many foods become easier to digest and enjoy.

This list is a guiding framework — not a rigid diet.

✅ Pro-Metabolic Foods (Recommended)
Fruits & Fruit Juices

Orange juice

Apples & applesauce

Mango

Pineapple

Ripe peaches

Ripe papaya

Ripe berries (if tolerated)

Cherries

Watermelon

Grapes

Melons

Dried fruits (dates, figs) if tolerated

Honey

Maple syrup

Why: Easy to digest, rich in fructose (supports liver glycogen), vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, carbs for thyroid + energy.

Roots & Easy-Digestible Carbs

Potatoes (boiled, mashed, baked)

Sweet potatoes (if tolerated)

Carrots (daily carrot salad recommended)

Beets (cooked)

Squash

White rice

Rice noodles

Sourdough bread (if tolerated)

Dairy (if tolerated)

Milk (whole, 2%, skim depending on digestion)

Cheese

Greek yogurt

Cottage cheese

Cream (in small amounts)

Kefir (if tolerated)

Why: Highly bioavailable protein, calcium, sugar, nutrients that support thyroid + hormones.

If dairy isn’t tolerated, it often becomes tolerable later in healing.

Animal Proteins

Grass-fed beef

Lamb

Bison

White fish

Shellfish (oysters, shrimp, scallops — very Peat-approved)

Eggs

Liver (1–2x/week — extremely nutrient dense)

Gelatin + collagen

Why: Supports thyroid, maintains muscle, stabilizes blood sugar, balances amino acids.

Fats (Clean, Stable Fats)

Butter

Ghee

Coconut oil

MCT oil

Beef tallow

Small amounts of olive oil

Why: Saturated fats protect the thyroid, reduce inflammation, improve metabolism.

Pro-Metabolic Extras
Daily Carrot Salad

Shredded carrot + vinegar + salt + coconut oil
Reduces endotoxin, improves digestion, lowers estrogen, supports liver.

Cooked White Mushrooms

Anti-estrogenic, gut-supportive, anti-inflammatory.

Bone Broth / Gelatin

Supports gut lining, skin, sleep, and metabolism.

Salt

Supports adrenal function, blood sugar, and thyroid.

Coffee with Sugar & Milk

Supports liver, boosts metabolism, increases CO₂ — if tolerated.

⚠️ Foods to Limit or Avoid for Metabolic Healing

These are foods frequently found to slow metabolism, raise inflammation, increase estrogen, or burden digestion — according to Ray Peat, Georgi Dinkov, Kate Deering, and bioenergetic research.

❌ PUFAs (Polyunsaturated Fats)

The biggest category to avoid.

Found in:

Seed oils (canola, soy, safflower, sunflower, corn)

Nuts & nut butters

Almond milk

Vegan “health foods”

Most packaged foods

Fried foods

Commercial salad dressings

Why avoid:
Suppress thyroid, increase inflammation, slow metabolism, disrupt hormones.

❌ Hard-to-Digest Fibers & Raw Vegetables

Especially:

Raw broccoli, raw kale

Raw cauliflower

Raw spinach

Raw cruciferous veggies

Big salads

Legumes (beans, lentils) unless very well-cooked

Why:
Slow metabolism, irritate the gut, increase endotoxin.

(Cooked versions are often better.)

❌ Grains & Flours (for some people)

Many struggle with:

Whole wheat

Oats

Corn

Multigrain breads

Others tolerate fine — individuality matters here.

❌ Fatty Pork + Fatty Poultry

High in PUFA unless trimmed or cooked in a way to remove the fat.

❌ Excessive Caffeine Without Fuel

Leads to:

Anxiety

Crashes

Sleep disruption

Cortisol spikes

Coffee + sugar + milk = best.

❌ Fasting

Depletes liver glycogen and forces the body to rely on stress hormones (cortisol & adrenaline) for fuel.

This slows metabolism long-term.

🧠 The Principle to Remember

There are no rigid rules in the pro-metabolic approach.
Your body heals through nourishment, warmth, rest, and safety — not restriction.

Food becomes easier to digest as your metabolism strengthens.
What doesn’t work now may work beautifully later.

This list helps you choose foods that support energy, thyroid function, digestion, hormones, and overall metabolic resilience.
