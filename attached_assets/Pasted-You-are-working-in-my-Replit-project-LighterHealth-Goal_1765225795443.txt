You are working in my Replit project **LighterHealth**.

Goal:
On the **Dashboard**, directly **below the Daily Snapshot**, I want to show:

* A **small 30-day Pulse trend line**
* A **small 30-day Temperature trend line**

These should be **minimal, compact, and visually clean** — just enough for users to instantly see if things are improving over time.

Do **not** add any additional trends (energy, sleep, stress, etc.).
Only **Pulse + Temperature**.

---

## 1. Data source (important)

Use the same stored vitals data that already powers:

* Pulse tracking
* Temperature tracking
* The 7-day stress chart

You must:

* Fetch the **last 30 days** of:

  * `pulse`
  * `temperature`
* Sort by date ascending
* Ignore days with missing data

---

## 2. UI placement

In `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`:

Place the new section:

✅ **Directly below the “Daily Snapshot” card**
✅ **Above any existing insights or experiment sections**

Add a small section title:

**“30-Day Metabolic Trends”**

Then show **two small line charts side-by-side**:

* Left: **Pulse (bpm)**
* Right: **Temperature (°F)**

Each chart should have:

* No heavy grid
* No legends
* No numbers on every point
* Just:

  * a faint baseline
  * a smooth, soft line
  * subtle glow using the same amber / coral accent used elsewhere

---

## 3. Visual style requirements

Match existing dark dashboard styling:

* Background: same dark glassy card look as Daily Snapshot
* Line color:

  * Pulse → soft coral / peach
  * Temperature → warm amber / gold
* Rounded corners
* Subtle gradient glow behind each line

These trends should feel:

* calming
* premium
* not “clinical”

---

## 4. Behavior

* These charts must:

  * Automatically update when the user logs new pulse or temp data
  * Persist after refresh
* If fewer than 5 data points exist:

  * Show a soft placeholder message like:
    “Trend will appear after a few days of logging.”

---

## 5. Do NOT change:

* The Daily Snapshot layout
* The Track page
* The Stress / Sleep / Energy charts elsewhere
* Experiments
* Any backend logic unrelated to fetching vitals history

This is a **UI + data fetch addition only** for the Dashboard.

---

## 6. Testing

After implementing:

1. Log pulse + temp for multiple days.
2. Confirm:

   * Trends render correctly.
   * Trend lines move as expected.
   * Refresh does NOT wipe them.
3. Confirm mobile layout stacks the two trends vertically instead of squeezing them.
