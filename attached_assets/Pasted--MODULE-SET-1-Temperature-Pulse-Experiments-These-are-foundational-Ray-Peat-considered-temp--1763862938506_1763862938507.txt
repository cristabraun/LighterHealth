⭐ MODULE SET 1 — Temperature & Pulse Experiments

These are foundational. Ray Peat considered temp + pulse the core metabolic barometers.

Module 1: Temperature Before + After Meals

Purpose: Reveal how well your body is converting food into energy.

Why it works:
If a meal raises temp/pulse → metabolism is strong.
If it drops → low thyroid or high cortisol response.

How to do it:

Take temperature and pulse before eating.

Eat a normal meal.

Measure again 30–60 minutes later.

Track:

Temperature change

Pulse change

Bloating

Mood shift

Energy

Expected results:
✔ Warmth increase
✔ Stable pulse
✔ Better digestion

Alternatives:
If someone hates tracking numbers, let them track:

“Warmer / Cooler / Same”

“Calmer / Anxious / Same”

Module 2: Morning vs Afternoon Temp/Pulse

Purpose: Identify low thyroid or high cortisol patterns.

Why it works:
AM is lowest metabolism. PM should be highest.
If reversed → cortisol dominance.

How to do it:
Take temp + pulse upon waking, then again mid-afternoon.

Track:

Warmth

Calmness

Hunger

Expected:
Afternoon temp 98.6°F / pulse 70–90.

Alternative:
If stressed — only track warmth, not pulse.

Module 3: Warm vs Cold Foods Experiment

Why:
Warm foods = parasympathetic.
Cold foods = cortisol spike.

Choose warm meals for 24 hours.

Alternative:
If someone likes cold foods, have them warm only the protein portion.
