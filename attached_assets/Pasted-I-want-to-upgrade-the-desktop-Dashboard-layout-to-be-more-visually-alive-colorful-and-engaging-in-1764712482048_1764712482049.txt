I want to upgrade the desktop Dashboard layout to be more visually alive, colorful, and engaging, inspired by the screenshot I uploaded. Please implement the following enhancements ONLY for desktop (lg+ screens). Keep the mobile layout untouched.

IMPORTANT DESIGN GUIDELINES:
• Keep my existing brand colors as the base (coral, peach, blush, soft neutrals).
• You may add additional ACCENT COLORS for fun and variation (soft purples, warm yellows, light blues, pinks)—similar to the screenshot.
• Do NOT rebrand the entire color palette.
• Cards should stay rounded, soft, feminine, and spacious.
• Use my current card components + Tailwind classes.
• Desktop layout should look vibrant, multi-sectioned, and dynamic.

CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT ON DASHBOARD:
---------------------------------------

### 1. Add Stress Trend Chart (Line Graph)
• Add a new Card in the RIGHT COLUMN under the Score Card.
• Label: “Stress Trend (7 days)”
• Use a soft coral-to-peach gradient line.
• Add circular data points like the screenshot.
• Use placeholder data for now.

### 2. Add Sleep Trend Chart (7-day bar or line)
• Place this chart BELOW the Stress Chart.
• Label: “Sleep Quality (7 days)”
• Use a light blue or lavender accent color for the chart bars/line.
• Light, airy card design like the screenshot’s charts.

### 3. Add Mood Card (Yesterday → Today)
• Add a small colorful card in LEFT COLUMN.
• Should look like the “Photos / Music / Videos” colorful tiles in the screenshot.
• Use 2–3 colors total (e.g., purple tile, peach tile, yellow tile).
• Card contents:
  - Title: “Mood”
  - Yesterday mood icon + label
  - Today mood icon + label
• Use expressive emojis.

### 4. Add Daily Wins / Consistency Meter
• Add a circular gauge similar to the colorful arc in the screenshot.
• Place in LEFT COLUMN under the Mood Card.
• Label: “Consistency This Week”
• Use a multi-color arc (pastel purple → pastel yellow → pastel coral).
• Display percentage or “4 of 7 days complete”.

### 5. Make the Dashboard More Colorful (But On-Brand)
Apply the following changes to match the screenshot’s spirit:
• Add subtle colored backgrounds to certain cards (e.g., soft purple, soft yellow).
• Mix accent colors safely (lavender, light blue, soft pink).
• Keep primary coral as the anchor color.
• Maintain Tailwind’s dark mode compatibility.

### 6. Maintain Desktop Structure
Ensure these new elements fit into the existing two-column layout that was just created:
- LEFT COLUMN:
  1) Daily Snapshot Card
  2) Quick Links (Track / Experiments / Message)
  3) Mood Card
  4) Daily Wins / Consistency Meter
  5) Recent Experiments Card

- RIGHT COLUMN:
  1) Score Card
  2) Weekly Activity Chart (existing placeholder)
  3) Stress Trend Chart (new)
  4) Sleep Trend Chart (new)
  5) Daily Reminder Card
  6) Support Cards (Message Me / Book a Call)
  7) Insights Card

### 7. Keep Existing Logic
Do NOT remove or break:
• Data fetching
• State logic
• Navigation
• Mobile layout
• The greeting card

Just enhance the desktop visual design.

After you finish:

Show me the updated JSX structure for the new dashboard.tsx, including the new cards and charts, so I can confirm everything is correct.
