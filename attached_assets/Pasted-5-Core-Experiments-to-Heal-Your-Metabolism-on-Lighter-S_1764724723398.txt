5 Core Experiments to Heal Your Metabolism on Lighter
Simple, measurable practices based on pro-metabolic principles to restore energy, warmth, and vitality.

🌡️ Experiment 1: Track Your Temperature Daily
What it is:
Measure your body temperature 2–3 times per day to understand your baseline metabolic function and track improvements over time.
How to do it:

Take your temperature upon waking (before getting out of bed)
Take it again mid-morning (around 10–11 AM)
Take it once more in the afternoon (around 2–4 PM)
Use an oral or underarm thermometer
Log your readings in the Lighter app along with how you feel

Why it matters:
Temperature is your metabolism's fuel gauge. It shows whether your thyroid is active and your cells are producing adequate energy. Tracking creates awareness and reveals patterns—you'll see which foods, activities, and lifestyle choices raise your temperature (meaning they support your metabolism) and which ones lower it (meaning they create metabolic stress).
What you're looking for:

Gradual upward trends toward 97.8–98.6°F
More consistent readings throughout the day
Correlation between warmer temps and better energy/mood
Warm hands and feet accompanying higher readings

The healing insight:
When you see your temperature rise consistently, you're witnessing cellular energy production improve in real time. This isn't subjective—it's measurable metabolic healing.

🥕 Experiment 2: Eat a Daily Carrot Salad
What it is:
One raw carrot salad per day, designed to gently cleanse excess estrogen, endotoxins, and inflammatory compounds from your digestive system.
How to make it:

1 large raw carrot, shredded or grated
1–2 tablespoons coconut oil or olive oil
1 tablespoon vinegar (apple cider or white)
Pinch of salt

Mix and eat, preferably between meals or before dinner.
Why it matters:
Raw carrots contain unique insoluble fibers that bind to excess estrogen, bacterial endotoxins, and bile acids in your intestines, helping your body eliminate them before they're reabsorbed. This reduces the toxic load on your liver, lowers systemic inflammation, and helps rebalance hormones—all of which support better thyroid function and metabolic rate.
What you might notice:

Improved digestion and regularity
Reduced bloating
Better mood and less PMS
Clearer skin
More stable energy
Gradual reduction in stress-related symptoms

The healing insight:
Your gut health directly impacts your metabolic health. By reducing endotoxin and estrogen recirculation, you're removing metabolic brakes that have been slowing down your thyroid and energy production. This simple daily practice creates space for your metabolism to function more efficiently.

🚫 Experiment 3: Eliminate PUFAs (Polyunsaturated Fats)
What it is:
Systematically remove seed oils and PUFA-rich foods from your diet and replace them with stable, metabolism-supporting fats.
How to do it:
Foods/oils to eliminate:

Canola, soybean, corn, sunflower, safflower oils
Vegetable oil and "blended" oils
Most restaurant and packaged foods (read labels carefully)
Margarine and industrial spreads
Most nuts and seeds (especially in large quantities)
Conventional chicken and pork (high in PUFA from feed)

Replace with:

Butter (grass-fed when possible)
Coconut oil
Olive oil (in moderation, not heated)
Beef tallow or lamb fat
Dairy fats (cream, cheese, whole milk)
Cacao butter

Why it matters:
PUFAs are chemically unstable and easily oxidize in your body, where they accumulate in cell membranes and interfere with mitochondrial respiration. They directly suppress thyroid function, block glucose metabolism, promote inflammation, and increase estrogen dominance. Removing them is often the single most powerful metabolic intervention you can make.
What you might notice:

Increased body warmth (especially in hands and feet)
More stable energy without crashes
Reduced inflammation and pain
Better hormone balance
Improved sleep quality
Weight loss or easier weight management
Clearer thinking

The healing insight:
PUFAs have accumulated in your tissues over years or decades. As you stop consuming them and they gradually clear from your system, your mitochondria can finally produce energy efficiently again. This experiment often creates the most dramatic and sustained improvements because you're removing a fundamental metabolic blocker.
Timeline note: Full PUFA clearance can take 2–4 years, but most people notice significant improvements within weeks to months.

☀️ Experiment 4: Get Sunlight Daily
What it is:
Expose your skin and eyes to natural sunlight every day, prioritizing morning and midday light.
How to do it:

Get outside within 30–60 minutes of waking
Aim for 10–30 minutes of direct sunlight on your skin (arms, legs, face)
Don't wear sunglasses during safe morning/evening light
Take a midday sun break when possible (even 5–10 minutes helps)
If you work indoors, eat lunch outside or take walking breaks
In winter or low-light climates, maximize whatever light exposure you can get

Why it matters:
Sunlight does far more than produce vitamin D. Morning light sets your circadian rhythm, which regulates cortisol, melatonin, thyroid function, and metabolic rate. UV exposure supports steroid hormone production (including progesterone and pregnenolone), reduces inflammation, improves mitochondrial function, and directly supports cellular energy production. Red and near-infrared wavelengths penetrate deep into tissues and enhance ATP generation.
What you might notice:

Better sleep quality and easier waking
Improved mood and reduced anxiety
More consistent energy throughout the day
Reduced inflammation and pain
Better stress resilience
Improved body temperature regulation
Enhanced sense of vitality

The healing insight:
Your body is designed to interact with natural light. Modern indoor living has disconnected us from this fundamental metabolic signal. Sunlight exposure recalibrates your hormonal and circadian systems, allowing your metabolism to function according to its natural design. Light is information—and your metabolism needs that information to heal.

💝 Experiment 5: Do Something You Love Daily & Come Home to Your Body
What it is:
Intentionally engage in an activity that brings you genuine joy, relaxation, or fulfillment every single day—and practice being fully present in your body while doing it.
How to do it:
Choose activities that genuinely nourish you:

Creative pursuits (painting, music, writing, crafting)
Gentle movement you enjoy (walking, dancing, swimming, stretching)
Social connection (calling a friend, quality time with loved ones)
Being in nature (gardening, hiking, sitting outside)
Reading, listening to music, cooking a beautiful meal
Any hobby or practice that makes you feel alive and peaceful

The "coming home" practice:

While doing your chosen activity, actively relax your shoulders, jaw, and belly
Breathe slowly and fully
Notice sensations in your body without judgment
Let go of rushing or productivity pressure
Give yourself full permission to simply be rather than constantly do
Practice feeling safe in your body

Why it matters:
Chronic stress and nervous system dysregulation suppress metabolism just as powerfully as poor nutrition. When you're constantly in fight-or-flight mode—rushing, worrying, pushing, never feeling safe or satisfied—your body produces cortisol and adrenaline instead of thyroid hormone and progesterone. True metabolic healing requires nervous system healing.
Joy, presence, and embodied relaxation signal to your body that it's safe to produce energy, digest food properly, balance hormones, and invest in healing rather than survival.
What you might notice:

Decreased anxiety and mental tension
Better digestion (especially when you eat in a relaxed state)
Improved sleep
More stable mood and emotional resilience
Reduced pain and inflammation
Higher body temperature and steadier pulse
A sense of finally feeling "like yourself" again

The healing insight:
Your metabolism cannot fully heal while your nervous system remains in chronic stress mode. Doing what you love isn't selfish or indulgent—it's a metabolic necessity. When you come home to your body through presence and joy, you're literally signaling your cells that it's safe to shift from stress-based survival metabolism to energy-abundant, regenerative metabolism.
This experiment recognizes that you are not a machine to be optimized—you're a living being whose energy and healing capacity flourish in conditions of safety, pleasure, and genuine self-care.

🌟 How to Use These Experiments on Lighter
Start with tracking:
Temperature tracking (Experiment 1) gives you objective data to measure whether the other experiments are working for your unique body.
Add experiments gradually:
You don't need to do all five perfectly from day one. Start with one or two, establish consistency, then add more. Track your temperature, symptoms, and how you feel throughout.
Look for patterns:
Use the Lighter app to log your experiments and notice:

Which combinations increase your temperature most
How your energy and mood shift over time
What creates the biggest improvements in your specific symptoms

Trust the process:
Metabolic healing isn't linear. You may have ups and downs, but consistent practice of these experiments creates the conditions for your body to restore its natural energy-producing capacity.
The fundamental truth:
These aren't restrictions or punishments—they're invitations to provide your body with what it's been missing: stable fuel sources, reduced toxic load, natural light, nervous system safety, and the conditions for cellular energy to flourish.
When you give your body these things consistently, your metabolism remembers how to heal.
