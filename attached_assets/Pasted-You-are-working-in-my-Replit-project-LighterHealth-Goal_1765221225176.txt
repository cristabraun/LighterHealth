You are working in my Replit project **LighterHealth**.

Goal:
Right now, after a user logs in, the app flow and navigation treat the **Track** page as the primary page. I want to change this so that:

1. **Dashboard is the main/first page** users land on after logging in or finishing onboarding.
2. **Track becomes the second page** in the navigation (after Dashboard), not the first.

Please update the routing and nav so the app feels “Dashboard-first”.

Concrete requirements:

1. **Change the default logged-in route to Dashboard**

   * Find where the main routes are defined (likely in `client/src/App.tsx` or similar).
   * Wherever the app currently redirects users after successful login/onboarding (for example to `/track` or `/start-here`), change it so they go to the **Dashboard** route instead (`/dashboard`).
   * If there is a “home” route or root redirect (`/`), make sure that for authenticated users it ends up on **Dashboard**, not Track.

2. **Update navigation order so Dashboard is first, Track second**

   * Find the component(s) that define the primary navigation (sidebar, top nav, or tab bar). This might be:

     * a `navItems` array, or
     * a `MainLayout` / `AppShell` component, or
     * any shared navigation component.
   * Make sure the order is:

     1. **Dashboard**
     2. **Track**
        (then whatever comes after: Experiments, Learn, Messages, etc.)
   * If any icons or labels still visually highlight Track as the “main” page, update them so Dashboard looks like the primary section.

3. **Make sure all “back home” / “start” links go to Dashboard**

   * Search for any buttons or links whose intent is “go to the main app” or “start tracking” (for example labels like “Go to app”, “Start here”, “Continue”, “Back to home”).
   * If they currently route to `/track` or some other page, update them so they route to `/dashboard` instead, unless they very specifically need to go to Track.
   * The idea: after onboarding, login, or coming back from auth, the **first experience is Dashboard**.

4. **Do NOT break the Track page**

   * The Track page should still exist at its route (probably `/track`) and work exactly as before.
   * Only change:

     * The default landing route after login/onboarding.
     * The order and target of navigation links.

5. **Verify behavior**

   * Run the app and test:

     * Log in or register a new user: confirm you land on **Dashboard** first.
     * Use the navigation to go to Track, Experiments, etc.: confirm Dashboard is first, Track is second.
     * Use any “Back to home” or “Get started” buttons and confirm they go to Dashboard, not Track.

Once you’ve confirmed it works, format any modified files.
