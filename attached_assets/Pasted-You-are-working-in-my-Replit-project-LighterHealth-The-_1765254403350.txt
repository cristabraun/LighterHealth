You are working in my Replit project “LighterHealth”. The goal is to fix the PWA / home-screen icon.

Current problem:
When I “Add to Home Screen” on my phone, the icon is just a plain white square with no branding. It should show my three-star Lighter™ icon and the app name should show as “Lighter™” (or “Lighter” as the short name).

Please do ALL of the following:

Find and use the branded icon asset

Locate the existing three-star Lighter™ icon in the repo (for example: lighter_app_icon_coral_gradient.png or similar).

If needed, generate/export the correct sizes and place them in public/ (or public/icons/):

192x192 PNG

512x512 PNG

32x32 favicon

180x180 PNG for iOS apple-touch-icon

Fix / create public/manifest.json

Ensure there is a manifest.json under public/.

Set:

"name": "Lighter™"

"short_name": "Lighter"

"display": "standalone"

"start_url": "/"

"background_color" and "theme_color" to the dark warm brown / amber tone used in the app.

Make sure the "icons" array correctly points to the real icon files you created, e.g.:

"icons": [
  { "src": "/icons/icon-192x192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" },
  { "src": "/icons/icon-512x512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png" }
]


Confirm the manifest is served from the root and has the correct Content-Type: application/manifest+json.

Wire the manifest and icons into the main HTML layout

In the main HTML/layout file (e.g. client/index.html or the root HTML template the app actually uses):

Add:

<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/icons/favicon-32x32.png" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="Lighter™" />
<meta name="application-name" content="Lighter™" />


Make sure any old favicon links or conflicting tags are cleaned up so only the new icons are used.

Handle iOS specifically

Confirm that iOS will use the apple-touch-icon file from public/icons/.

Make sure the icon file used for iOS is not just a white square (no white background override, correct transparency and colors from the three-star icon).

Verify and test

Run the app and open it from the deployed domain (https://getlighterapp.com, not just the Replit preview).

Use browser dev tools / Application tab to confirm:

The manifest is detected and valid.

The icons listed in the manifest load without 404s.

Then simulate the flow:

On Android (or Chrome’s PWA install): install to home screen and confirm the home-screen icon shows the branded three-star Lighter™ icon with the correct name.

On iOS Safari: “Add to Home Screen” and confirm:

Icon shows the three-star Lighter™ icon

Title shows as “Lighter” / “Lighter™” as configured.

Cache / icon refresh

If necessary, bump icon filenames (e.g. add -v2 in the file names and manifest) to avoid cached old icons.

Ensure no outdated icons or manifests are still referenced anywhere in the code.

Summary

When you’re done, summarize:

Which files you changed (manifest, HTML/layout, icon paths).

Exactly which icon files and sizes you created/used.

On which platforms you tested “Add to Home Screen” and what the icon and name look like now.

The end result should be:

When I add the app to my home screen on a phone, I see the branded Lighter™ three-star icon, not a white box, and the app name appears as Lighter™ (or “Lighter”) under the icon.
