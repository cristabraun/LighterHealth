Food Is Fuel — And the Type of Fuel Changes Everything

In the bioenergetic, pro-metabolic view, food isn’t just calories.
It’s information that tells your cells whether they should:

create energy efficiently

or conserve energy and stress

The goal is always the same:

Support the metabolism so your body can make energy easily, stay warm, stay calm, and burn fuel cleanly.

To do that, these three categories matter more than anything:
carbs, protein, and fats.

Let’s break down what each one does and how to use them to feel your best.

🍊 CARBS

Your metabolism runs on sugar — literally.

In the bioenergetic view, carbohydrates are the body’s preferred fuel because they create the most energy with the least stress.

Carbs:

support thyroid function

lower cortisol

stabilize mood

increase warmth

fuel the liver

help progesterone levels

improve sleep

reduce cravings

restore metabolic flexibility

When carbs are low:

cortisol rises to make up the difference

the body breaks down muscle

cravings spike later in the day

energy becomes unstable

metabolism slows

That’s why many restrictive, low-carb diets work short-term but feel terrible long-term — they rely on stress hormones to function.

The best carbs for metabolic health:

ripe fruit

fruit juice

honey

milk

root vegetables (carrots, potatoes, beets)

well-cooked white rice

sourdough bread

easily digested sugars

These foods are easy on digestion, stabilize blood sugar, and help the body produce clean energy.

Carbs that slow healing:

grains that are hard to digest (whole wheat, bran, oats)

raw leafy vegetables

beans/legumes

high-PUFA packaged foods

These can be irritating, inflammatory, or difficult to metabolize.

🧀 PROTEIN

Builds the body — but the type of protein changes how you feel.

Protein is necessary for:

tissue repair

hormones

immune function

blood sugar stability

detoxification

But not all proteins metabolize the same way.

Bioenergetic, pro-metabolic proteins:

dairy (milk, cheese, cottage cheese)

gelatin/collagen

eggs

shellfish (especially low-fat, mineral-rich ones like shrimp or oysters)

white fish

lean beef in moderate amounts

These proteins are:

easy to digest

low in inflammatory amino acids

balanced in minerals

supportive of thyroid function

Gelatin is especially important because it balances the inflammatory amino acids in muscle meat and supports gut health.

Proteins that increase stress load:

large amounts of muscle meat without gelatin

pork and chicken (high in PUFAs)

nut/seed “proteins”

plant proteins with antinutrients

These can raise inflammation and slow metabolic healing if eaten as primary sources.

🥥 FATS

The category that matters the most — and the one most people misunderstand.

In the bioenergetic view, the type of fat you eat strongly affects:

inflammation

thyroid function

energy production

hormone balance

metabolic rate itself

The metabolism-friendly fats:

saturated fats from dairy (butter, cream)

coconut oil

cocoa butter

beef tallow

small amounts of olive oil (low PUFA)

These fats:

support thyroid hormone conversion

protect against oxidative stress

stabilize blood sugar

help the body tolerate carbs better

❌ Fats that suppress metabolism (PUFAs)

PUFAs (polyunsaturated fats) are the #1 fat that slows metabolic healing.

Found in:

nuts & seeds

nut butters

vegetable oils (canola, soybean, safflower, sunflower)

most restaurant food

packaged snacks

pork & chicken

many “health” foods

PUFAs:

block thyroid hormone

increase estrogen

suppress metabolism

lower body temperature

increase inflammation

make cravings worse

destabilize blood sugar

impair mitochondrial energy production

Removing or drastically lowering PUFAs is often the fastest way to:

increase warmth

calm the nervous system

restore metabolic flexibility

improve sleep and digestion

support weight loss

🥣 Putting It All Together: How to Build a Pro-Metabolic Plate
Each meal should include:

Carbs (fruit, juice, roots, dairy, honey)

Protein (dairy, eggs, gelatin, fish, shellfish, lean meats)

Saturated fat (butter, coconut, dairy fat)

Why this matters:

Carbs + protein together:

stabilize blood sugar

lower cortisol

help muscles use glucose

support thyroid function

improve hunger/fullness signals

prevent overeating later

Fat (saturated) helps:

slow carb absorption gently

keep energy steady

reduce cravings

✨ What You’ll Notice When You Eat This Way

Many women report improvements in:

warmth

stable moods

deeper sleep

fewer cravings

better digestion

clearer skin

improved cycles

less bloating

more stable energy

sustainable fat loss

Not because they’re dieting —
but because they’re feeding the metabolism, not fighting it.
