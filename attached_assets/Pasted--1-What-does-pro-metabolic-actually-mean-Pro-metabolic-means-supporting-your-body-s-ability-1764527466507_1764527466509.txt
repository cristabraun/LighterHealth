## 1. What does “pro-metabolic” actually mean?

“Pro-metabolic” means supporting your body’s ability to create energy efficiently and consistently.

When your metabolism is strong, you:
- Feel warmer and more energetic  
- Digest food better  
- Sleep more deeply  
- Think more clearly  
- Handle stress better  
- Regulate hormones more easily  

The pro-metabolic approach focuses on:
- Nourishing foods (especially carbs + protein)  
- Warmth and safety  
- Nervous system calm  
- Blood sugar stability  
- Supportive movement  
- Lowering chronic stress hormones  

It’s not about restriction or punishment; it’s about building a body that has enough energy to heal.


## 2. Is this another diet?

No — this is not a diet.  
This is a healing approach designed to restore your metabolism, balance your hormones, and help your body feel safe and energized again.

You don’t have to cut out all your favorite foods or live in restriction. This method focuses on eating in a way that supports your thyroid, stabilizes blood sugar, reduces stress hormones, and improves digestion — so you can enjoy food without fear.

It’s not about punishment or deprivation.  
It’s about healing, nourishment, safety, and getting your metabolism working properly again. When your body feels supported, weight loss and better energy happen naturally.


## 3. Do I have to cut out all “bad” foods?

No — there are no rigid rules here.  
This approach is based on experimentation, learning what helps your energy and what slows it down. Some foods might not work for you right now, especially if digestion or stress hormones are high. That’s totally normal.

The goal is not restriction — the goal is metabolic efficiency.  
You’re learning which foods help your body burn fuel cleanly, stay warm, stay calm, and feel good.

If you avoid certain foods temporarily, it’s for healing — not punishment. And it doesn’t mean those foods are gone forever. As your metabolism strengthens, your digestion and tolerance often improve dramatically.


## 4. What if I’m sensitive to dairy, fruit, or sugar?

Food sensitivities are extremely common in stressed metabolisms.

You might react to:
- Dairy  
- Certain fruits  
- Sugar  
- Grains  

That doesn’t automatically mean those foods are “bad” — it usually means your digestion, thyroid, or stress response needs support.

As you:
- Lower stress  
- Improve digestion  
- Eat more regularly  
- Warm up your body  
- Support thyroid and hormones  

…your tolerance for many foods often improves. You can work with what your body handles right now and expand slowly over time.


## 5. Why does this app track temperature and pulse?

Because warmth and pulse are some of the most honest signals of how your metabolism is doing.

A healthier metabolism usually shows up as:
- Warm hands and feet  
- Comfortable body temperature  
- Calm, steady pulse (not crashing, not racing)  

Tracking temp and pulse helps you see:
- Which foods support your energy  
- How stress affects you  
- If your current habits are helping or overloading you  
- When your body feels safer and more regulated  

Instead of guessing, you can watch your body’s real-time responses.


## 6. Is fast weight loss possible with the pro-metabolic approach?

Fast weight loss isn’t the focus here.  
The focus is **safe, sustainable, and metabolism-friendly change**.

Most women have tried fast-loss methods already — and paid for it with:
- Hormone issues  
- Fatigue  
- Binge–restrict cycles  
- Anxiety  
- Rebound weight gain  

With a pro-metabolic approach, weight loss tends to happen more naturally as:
- Stress hormones come down  
- Thyroid and progesterone improve  
- Sleep gets better  
- Digestion smooths out  
- Blood sugar stabilizes  

It might feel slower at first, but it’s the path that actually lasts.


## 7. Can I still do cardio or normal workouts?

Yes — but how you train matters.

The goal is **supportive movement**, not wrecking yourself in the gym.

Pro-metabolic movement usually looks like:
- Lifting weights 2–4x per week  
- Walking regularly  
- Gentle conditioning (Pilates, barre, dance, light cycling)  
- Avoiding chronic long, intense cardio  

Long, punishing cardio and overtraining can:
- Raise cortisol and adrenaline  
- Suppress thyroid function  
- Increase cravings and fatigue  
- Stall fat loss  

You don’t need to stop all cardio forever — you just need to use it in a way that supports your metabolism instead of fighting it.


## 8. Do I need supplements?

Not everyone needs supplements, but many women do find them helpful as **support tools**.

Supplements can:
- Support sleep and nervous system calm  
- Help balance hormones  
- Support thyroid function  
- Reduce inflammation  
- Help digestion and energy  

But they **cannot** override:
- Chronic stress  
- Undereating  
- Extreme exercise  
- No sleep  
- Constant overwhelm  

Supplements work best on top of a foundation of nourishing food, warmth, rest, and nervous system safety. If you’re unsure where to start, it’s smart to speak with someone familiar with the bioenergetic / pro-metabolic approach.


## 9. Can this approach help with PMS, anxiety, or sleep problems?

Yes — those issues are often tied to:
- Low thyroid function  
- Blood sugar instability  
- High cortisol and adrenaline  
- Estrogen dominance  
- Poor digestion  
- Chronic stress  

By supporting:
- Regular eating  
- Pro-metabolic foods  
- Warmth  
- Nervous system regulation  
- Progesterone and thyroid function  

…many women see big improvements in PMS, mood swings, anxiety, and sleep over time. It’s not a magic switch, but it goes after the root causes.


## 10. How long does it take to see results?

It depends on how stressed and depleted your system is to begin with.

Rough guide:
- **1–3 weeks:** many women notice changes in warmth, energy, digestion, and mood  
- **3–6 months:** deeper hormone and cycle changes often show up  
- **6–12 months:** more stable, long-term metabolic improvements  

This is a nervous-system and metabolism healing journey, not a quick fix. The app helps you see progress through data (temp, pulse, symptoms) so you’re not guessing.


## 11. Can I follow this if I’m vegan or vegetarian?

Vegetarians usually can; strict vegans have a harder time.

This approach emphasizes:
- Dairy  
- Eggs  
- Gelatin / collagen  
- Shellfish  
- Animal proteins  

Because of their impact on hormones, thyroid, and the nervous system.

If you’re vegetarian, it’s still very workable with:
- Dairy, eggs, and gelatin  
- Fruit, roots, and saturated fats  

If you’re vegan, some principles (carbs, warmth, stress reduction) still help, but hitting protein and micronutrient targets gets trickier and may need extra planning or support.


## 12. Will this help me lose weight?

Yes, indirectly — by getting your metabolism and hormones working *with* you instead of *against* you.

When you:
- Eat enough and regularly  
- Lower stress hormones  
- Sleep better  
- Support thyroid and progesterone  
- Improve digestion  

…your body feels safer and more efficient at burning energy. Bloating falls, cravings calm down, and your body is more willing to let go of stored fat.

Weight loss here is a **side effect of healing**, not the only goal.


## 13. Why are carbs encouraged here?

Because carbs are one of the main fuels for a healthy thyroid and nervous system.

Carbs:
- Refill liver glycogen  
- Calm stress hormones  
- Support progesterone and thyroid  
- Help you sleep  
- Stabilize mood and energy  

When carbs are too low for too long, your body leans on cortisol and adrenaline to keep you going — which is the opposite of healing.

This approach encourages the **right carbs** (fruit, juice, roots, easy-to-digest starches) in combination with protein and salt.


## 14. Why are seed oils discouraged?

Seed oils (high-PUFA oils like soybean, canola, sunflower, safflower, corn, etc.) are discouraged because they:

- Slow thyroid function  
- Increase inflammation  
- Make cells more fragile and easily damaged  
- Promote estrogen dominance  
- Make metabolism less efficient over time  

Replacing them with more stable fats like:
- Butter  
- Ghee  
- Coconut oil  
- Beef tallow  

…is a big lever for improving metabolic health, hormones, and energy.


## 15. Why do you emphasize warmth so much?

Because temperature is one of the clearest reflections of metabolic function.

Cold body = more stress hormones.  
Warm body = more real energy.

When you’re constantly cold:
- Thyroid is often under-functioning  
- Stress hormones are doing too much  
- Digestion, mood, and hormones usually struggle  

When you’re warm and comfortable:
- Food is being converted to energy  
- Blood is flowing well  
- Muscles and brain work better  
- You feel safer and more grounded  

That’s why the app pays so much attention to temp, pulse, and how warm you feel in daily life.
