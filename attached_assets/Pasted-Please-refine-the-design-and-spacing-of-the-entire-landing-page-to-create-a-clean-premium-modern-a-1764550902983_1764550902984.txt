Add ~20px more space above the subtitle.

Slightly reduce the space below the subtitle.

Left column = service name
Right column = price

Add thin dividers between each row.

Bold the “Lighter™ — $19/mo” row.

Add a light background behind this entire block.

Add a centered section header above it:
“Why Lighter™ Makes Sense”

5. “WHAT YOU GET WITH LIGHTER™” SECTION

Slightly increase padding between items.

Reduce the space between the bold title and its description sentence.

6. “WHY YOU CAN TRUST LIGHTER™” SECTION

Use modern checkmark icons for bullets.

Reduce vertical spacing between bullet items by ~20%.

Add a little extra top margin above the header.

8. “HI, I’M CRISTA” SECTION

Add 15–25px more space between the image and the text.

Make the image slightly smaller for better balance.

Add either a subtle border radius or soft shadow around the image.

Increase top margin above the section header.

9. FINAL CTA SECTION

Add more top padding so the section is clearly separated from the founder story.

Add additional bottom padding to create a balanced, elegant closing block.

Slightly increase the button size.
