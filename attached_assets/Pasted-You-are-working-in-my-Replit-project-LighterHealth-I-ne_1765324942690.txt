## Welcome to Lighter™ — Start Here

### What Lighter Is All About

Lighter helps you heal your metabolism so you can have **more energy, less stress, better sleep, balanced hormones, and a body that feels good again.**

But this is about **so much more than weight loss.**
When your metabolism is healthy, *every area of your life improves.* You have real energy. Your mood stabilizes. You feel grounded and present. You can show up as your best self—for yourself and for the people you love.

Lighter is about **reducing stress, slowing down, and making life more enjoyable again.**
When you stop forcing your body and start supporting it, everything shifts. You gain patience, clarity, and joy. Life stops feeling like a constant struggle.

The key difference:
Most diets stress your body out—**fasting, restricting, overtraining.**
We do the opposite. **We give your body what it needs to create energy efficiently so it can actually thrive.**

**Remember:**
We get healthy so we can lose weight.
We don’t lose weight so we can get healthy.

## What We Track & Why

### 🌡️ Temperature & Pulse

These two numbers tell you how well your metabolism is working.

**Temperature**

• **Morning:** Moving toward **97.8–98.6°F**
(Below **97.5°F** = sluggish metabolism)
• **Daytime:** Should rise into the **high 98s**

**Pulse**

• Ideal range: **75–90 bpm**
• Not racing. Not sluggish.

**What improves both:**
Easily digestible carbs, quality protein, and **lower stress.**

### 📊 Daily Tracking

Log these daily to see patterns:

• Stress levels
• Sleep quality
• Digestion

You’ll start clearly seeing:

## Start With These 3 Experiments

Experiments are what make Lighter different. Start with these three:

### 1. Daily Carrot Salad

Raw carrot + vinegar + salt.
Supports estrogen detox, reduces endotoxins, and improves digestion.

### 2. Eliminate PUFAs

Remove seed oils and high-PUFA foods.
This is one of the **most powerful metabolism healers.**

### 3. Track Temperature After Meals

Take your temp **30–60 minutes after eating.**
If it rises → that food supports your metabolism.
If it drops → that food may be stressing your system.
